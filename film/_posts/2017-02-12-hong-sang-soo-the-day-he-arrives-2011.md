The Day He Arrives is the first film I've seen from Hon Sang-soo - I first heard of him when the local indie cinema here had a trailer for Right Now, Wrong Then, which seemed to have similar thematic elements at least - explorations of the concept of eternal recurrence, permuted on the scale of a day or moment instead of, say, a lifetime.

The recurring scene here is actually quite simple: the Seong-jun is in Seoul, seemingly just arriving from the country where he was before. He meets up with hsi friend, Young-ho, usually with some sort of escapade in between arriving and meeting up with him. They and Bo-ram (Young-ho's friend) get drinks at Ye-jeon's bar, get drunk, and the night ends (or melds into the next one). Of course, the characters themselves even talk at length about the nature of coincidences and their incomprehensibility - though we try to 'connect the dots' and name that line of our own creation: 'reason'.

In a way, the occurrence of the coincidences is actually irrelevant – what matters here is the way we react to them. Whereas Groundhog Day, which is similar for obvious reasons, culminates in escape from the repeating day through living it the Correct Way (being Christ-like, as it were), Hong doesnt seem to make any sort of call of judgment here – instead seeing the various permutations as we go through the loop being interesting in themselves, not something that can be escaped, and in a way, even recognized, as the characters recognize certain random coincidences, but not the fact that they seem to be reliving the same sequence over and over again, only the superficial moments within that grander cycle.

There is also notions of recurrence at a broader level, even a sort of Cloud-Atlas-like exploration of the theme of certain archetypal characters are living out similar lives throughout time, kaleidoscopic-like. This shows up in the fact that Seong-jun’s former girlfriend, who he broke up with before leaving Seoul, and revisits on his first night, looks the same as the woman who owns the bar (same actor), who he ends up falling for. And just as he left his girlfriend after the brief reunion, ‘for the good of the both of us’, so he leaves the woman he ‘loves’ at the bar as well, explaining again that it is for the sake of ‘making her happy, which is the most important thing’ to him.

In a way, the film seems terribly depressing – with that eastern/Buddhist undercurrent of the emptiness of the recurring nature of life itself, but in a way that is the source of the beauty the film tries to sketch for us. Though we only get a peak at a couple of day period, things seem to be convering onto a brigher and better day – one sees that as we take the input to infinity, we converge upon more perfect and aesthetic permutations of the same themes. We can see that in Young-ho and Bo-ram getting progressively closer throughout the series of days, culminating in Young-ho saying he will ‘try harder’ (that is, actually try to not be so emotionally distant for the sake of maintaining friendship) as Bo-ram explains that she feels so very lonely after she lost her dog (presumably she looked for it every day, always chancing upon a scene slightly different).
