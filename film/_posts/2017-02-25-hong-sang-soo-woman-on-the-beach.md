There is something about the beach that invites a cool contemplation, it seems to have so many aspects that relate back to ourselves and our relation with the world at large, especially those others who occupy the same time as we. I always think of the poetic interludes in The Waves, Woolf describing that incessant beating of the water against the shore, being almost a heartbeat that exists before and after our proverbial day on the beach. As such, I’m a sucker for slice-of-life films that take place on the beach itself. There are a couple of good Rohmer ones, Pauline at the Beach comes to mind, and my main man Yang has an excellent one as well, I think it is called The Day at the Beach. Anyway, I had high hopes for this one, being an intersection of all these things with my favorite director as of late, Hong Sang-soo.

As one can expect, the film is about a director (Sang-soo’s shameless projection of himself, no doubt) a friend, and a woman (well, two). The protagonist gets the girl, loses her due to his own lack of commitment, regrets it, finds another who looks the same, gets the first one back, loses them both. 

The film is a lonely one, that is for sure. But it is a loneliness almost self-imposed, or rather, an inevitable thing ingrained into our very beings. The protagonist (Mun-suk), while succeeding in seduction, is haunted by strange insecurities, by images that he himself illustrates to be mere spooks, projections of his own ingrained circuits onto all that surrounds him. The love interest (Chang-uk) also has her own reality tunnel, colored by her relationship with her father who smothers her in love, leading her to distance herself from those who become too involved with her, though she feels bad about it. The rebound love interest is terrified of being betrayed after having her husband cheat on her, though that too happens when the protagonist leaves her for his first interest. 

All that being said, the film somehow remains upbeat. The lighthearted theme song plays in between moments of despair that seems to cast in it a beautiful light. Though the people don’t seem to fit together correctly, breaking away back onto their own paths, those moments of interaction are the sort of genuine bonds that life’s memories are made of. The protagonist, too, despite, or even because of, his failed romantic affairs, ends up finishing his script, which was the reason he spent time at the beach anyway – the script, incidentally, being about a character rying to find the reasoning, that hidden divine thread, that explains a momentous series of coincidences that happened to him some time ago in a single day. The film ends with the love interest (Chang-uk) getting her car stuck on the beach, and having others help push it out of the sand before she drives off, though disappointed  she could not find a way to thank them before leaving to presumably not see them ever again.

Actually, I had a poetic sort of thought about the beach not too long ago, maybe it was a dream, or just a waking musing. I’m on a beach at dawn and it is quite foggy out. I cannot see more than fifty meters in either direction, and I keep on walking forward by the waves. The beach itself is also sort of constrained, being no more than a couple of meters wide. I keep on walking and passing the people who come out of the fog. Sometimes I nod to them, other times I walk forward as though I do not see them, and they too, as they do not see me. Other times I stop and chat, or smile, before we go our separate ways. I wonder why I do not see any people going in the direction I am. I get a feeling they are there too, but perhaps behind me, or outside of the reach of my vision in the direction I walk. It keeps on going on like this, the same things said to the same sorts of people, because what else is to do on this beach of ours? Eventually the fog becomes progressively thicker until I only hear the waves and the sounds of my feet, and then nothing at all. I have to imagine, that even then, though I can no longer see or hear anything, those people are still walking, marching almost, to the drumming of the waves.
