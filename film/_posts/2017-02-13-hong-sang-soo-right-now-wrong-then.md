Do you believe that it is possible to be authentic - really authentic - in this day and age, in a wholesome sort of way. In some ways, I think the boundaries of acceptable discourse are increasingly shrinking. I go out to bars here with acquaintances and try to talk to them about film or music - or just life itself, and I feel that beyond a certain point everyone stone-walls. And even if we share interests - perhaps they even have seen this very film - it devolves into a sort of accounting of taste, tallying up which things we have spent some time watching in our respective rooms, alone. As though we could relate, really converse, through past experiences on those two separate screens.

Though sometimes I like to think that perhaps through sheer strength of will, perhaps we can all talk about what is on our mind, without the filters, and something beautiful can be said, you know? That the half-words and stumbling conversations are a result of a lack of effort, a lack of truthfulness - on me as much, if not more so, than them. That one of those conversations will be had that you you look back upon, regardless of how it may have ended - fizzled out as it were, as these things all do when the strength of the flame burns all the remaining material left that would otherwise have been merely chipped at - and say, "well damn, we really hit on something there, didn't we?" And we may not talk to each other for a long time, but if we saw each other we would nod and both know that we really did say something then, you know? We too would know that in all probability something like that wouldnt really come again, allowing us to savor the afterglow all the more.

This film is sort of like that.
