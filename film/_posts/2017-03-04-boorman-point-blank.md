Walker (and his wife, Lynne) are recruited for a simple job, stealing money from a drop on abandoned Alcatraz with his compatriot Mal. The load is lighter than they needed/expected, the tensions run high, Walker is shot in cold blood by Mal. He lives, and we follow his search for…

Point Blank is an existential drama in that New Hollywood style, masquerading as a crime thriller neo-noir. The composition of it is actually quite interesting, a sense of the experimental that borders on the sloppy, but still feels appropriate. The film itself starts with the shooting of Walker, showing it a couple times as different pieces of audio from the moments leading up to it layered on top of it, sometimes with the scene itself accompanying it. Boorman uses this mechanism of almost surreal flashback multiple times in the film, as we follow Walker throughout.

However, it is never quite clear what it is that Walker wants – indeed, he seems to be sucked into the need for action above all. There are many long shots where it shows him staring off into the distance – again interlaced with flashbacks of the things he has done so far. What starts from an impulse of revenge morphs itself into some sort of existential questioning of self – the progressive righting of wrongs doesn’t bring remediation, but rather is only a further conversation into the upending of the foundation aspects of his life. The flashbacks serve to remind us that these things are less of a story of justice, but reverberations of that traumatic seed the film began with.

Hell, even at the end when he receives his money from another drop, in the same place where that fateful mishap occurred at the beginning of the film, he remains in the shadows, despite the urging of his ‘employers’ to come out and take his payment. The film ends with those others commenting on the strangeness of such a man who doesn’t even go out to take what he aimed at recuperating. What is usually a proverbial closing of the loop is instead left open. We are left with a somewhat empty and sordid protagonist – both a victim and purveyor of further pain in the world – and lost within it.
